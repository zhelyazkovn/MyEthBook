 <h1>MyEthBook</h1>
 
<p>Store your address book on the blockchain!</p>

<p>It keeps important and frequently used addresses in secure manner, on blockchain, that could be easilly accessed from the DApp. Example: two and more friends participate in ICO with common budget and the one that succeeds has to transfer the coins to the others. Use MyEthBook for frequently used addresses - you don't remember the phone numbers of all your friends, do you? The final goal will be Ethereum book that acts as wallet, book, and portfolio -> will be combination between Blockfolio + My Ether Wallet + Address Book = MyEthManager (online banking for Ethereum tokens)</p>
